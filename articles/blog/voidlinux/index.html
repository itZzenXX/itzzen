	<h3>Switched from gentoo to void linux!</h3>
	<p>Hello! I recently decided to give Void GNU/Linux a try, and I really like it! The fast package manager and runit is just amazing!</p>
	<p>I dont like the fact that in order to libre my kernel, it would take a bit longer to do than to just do it on gentoo, but overall im really liking the expiriance!</p>
	<p>Cya all later! I'll be having some more fun on void :)</p>
