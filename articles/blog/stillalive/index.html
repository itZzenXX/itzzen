	<h3>STILL ALIVE!</h3>
  <p>heyo! Decided to write another blogpost after a while, sorry i got caught up in alot of stuff haha. I will be able to do more work on my website because school break! yay :)</p>
  <p>Oh yeah, if you noticed that the newer guides, blogposts, and other things are in black on white instaid of white on black, that is becase im no longer going to use CSS on these pages, I found them uneeded for simple text pages :)</p>
  <p>Also, my first guide is avalible soon! It's how to migrate openssl to libressl on gentoo post EOL. Yes I know LibreSSL is no longer supported but I want to help make migrating easier without much comminity support :D</p>
  <p>Anyways, ill be going back to writing the new guide, I'll see you all there! bye byeee</p>
