	<h3>life360 is borderline spyware and should NOT exist</h3>
	<p>life360 is a closed source spyware GPS tracker made for iOS and android that allows friends to "track" each others GPS.</p>
        <img src="images/life360.png"></>
	<h3>Saftey (lack there is)</h3>
	<p>Imagine this, you signed up to life360 and you start sharing your location, battery, etc etc. What happens if someone hacks into your account? They gain accesss to your active location, the "circles" your in + the GPS location of your friends or family members and giving them access to chat with them directly. You put yourself in danger using life360.</p>
	<h3>Spyware</h3>
	<p>The android and iOS app contains google and facebook trackers!</p>
	<p>No email or username to signup, you HAVE to use a phone number</p>
	<p>Your data and GPS data is not private as your data is uploaded to life360, as well as your driving data, they track how you DRIVE</p>
	<p>Going along with the first and second point, because of the google and facebook trackers, your data is ALSO intercepted by them and tracked to make money off of you.</p>
	<p>Dependency on Google Play Services botnet for android release</p>
	<h3>Restricting user freedom</h3>
	<p>Locking saftey features behind a paywall? What the hell is wrong with you. These include: Stolen phone insurance (This a feature that comes with most phones!), access to 24/7 support, emergency roadside assistance called "Driver Protect"</p> 
	<p>Many people are forced to use this, including myself.</p>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>If you are able to, delete your account and stop using Life360 immediately!
	<p>If you are forced to use Life360, try your best to make your parents aware of the awfulness that is this App, or if the whole family uses android, switch to <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/xyz.zood.george">zood</a>.</p>
